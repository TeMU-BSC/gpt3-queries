In the memorial booklet, his family described Benaud as 'a special person who means so much to each of us in many different ways.' Benaud, considered one of the most influential cricket identities of the past century, played 63 tests for Australia but was more well-known for his career in the commentating booth.

He was 86. He died of cancer at his home in Santa Monica, California, according to his wife, Kathryn Jacobi Dysart. For decades, Dysart was a noted TV and film character actor, and stage star, winning a Drama Desk award for playing coach in Jason Miller's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, \"That Championship Season.\" But it was as McKenzie, the occasionally crusty paterfamilias on \"L.A. Law,\" that he's likely best remembered. 'L.A. Law': Sex, crime and the 'Venus Butterfly' McKenzie usually took a back seat to the younger, more glamorous characters on \"Law,\" a Steven Bochco-created legal show that owed much to his previous hit, \"Hill Street Blues.\" The employees of McKenzie, Brackman, Chaney and Kuzak included Harry Hamlin's smooth-talking Michael Kuzak, Corbin Bernsen's skirt-chasing divorce attorney Arnie Becker and Michele Greene's idealistic Abby Perkins. There was as much time devoted to bedroom activities as there was legal issues while the show bravely took on such topics as AIDS, child molestation and capital punishment. But McKenzie was the one who kept them in check while still encouraging their better instincts. (Alan Rachins' Douglas Brackman was the business guy.) He was also involved in one of the show's most surprising plot twists: a romantic affair with a rival, Rosalind Shays (Diana Muldaur), who met with one of TV's most shocking deaths -- plunging down an elevator shaft. Dysart appeared in every episode of the show, which ran from 1986 to 1994. After \"L.A. Law\" ended, Dysart took few roles, though he did return for an \"L.A. Law\" reunion movie in 2002. Dysart's other credits include 1971's \"The Hospital,\" 1975's \"The Day of the Locust,\" 1979's \"Being There,\" John Carpenter's 1982 version of \"The Thing,\" 1985's \"The Falcon and the Snowman\" and 1987's \"Mask.\" He is survived by Jacobi Dysart, his wife of nearly three decades, a son and two grandchildren.

A Nationwide branch manager conned elderly customers out of their life savings by setting up bogus standing orders for hundreds of thousands of pounds. Hugo Mbaeri, 25, from Portsmouth allegedly handed over customer names, account details and signatures to a gang of fraudsters while he was working at Nationwide Building Society, a court heard. The alleged ringleader of the scheme, Olawabiyi Ayanwale, who is not before the court, set up standing orders by impersonating the victims, it is said. Mbaeri is on trial for fraud by abuse of position and conspiracy to commit fraud at the Old Bailey. He is in the dock alongside seven others who are accused of using their accounts to siphon the funds away. Abiola Balogun, 22, Gideon Boateng, 19, Tevin Campbell, 20, Joshua Clark, 20, Rebecca Jack, 21, Patrick Reddington, 20, and Christiana Tella, 19, were allegedly paid around \u00a3300 each for letting the fraudsters use their bank accounts. Prosecutor Jonathan Polnay described the scam as a \u2018nasty little fraud\u2019 that \u2018deliberately targeted elderly people with the aim of clearing them out of their life savings\u2019. \u2018Hugo Mbaeri is the inside man in this fraud and the remaining defendants in the dock allowed their accounts to be used for the stolen money to be passed through. \u2018It wasn\u2019t a particularly sophisticated fraud but it\u2019s a fraud which, were it not detected, would have netted the fraudsters hundreds of thousands of pounds and caused a loss in life savings to the victims. \u2018The set-up was quite straight forward - standing orders were set up from these elderly people\u2019s accounts to withdraw money. That\u2019s it, it\u2019s as simple as that. Mbaeri used the bank\u2019s computer system to access nine customers\u2019 details and signatures which he sold on to the fraudsters, the court was told. He worked as a cashier at the Fareham branch in Hampshire until February 2013 when he was promoted to branch manager in Gosport, Hampshire. The fraud was allegedly carried out from May 2012 to May 2013 and many of the victims were elderly or vulnerable, four were in their 80s and another three were over 65. \u2018We say Mr Mbaeri looked up those people\u2019s details for a dishonest purpose, not because they came into the branch or were making a genuine enquiry,\u2019 Mr Polnay said. Mbaeri is on trial for fraud by abuse of position and conspiracy to commit fraud at the Old Bailey (pictured). He is in the dock alongside seven others who are accused of using their accounts to siphon the funds away. \u2018They were older people, it\u2019s not just a random nine accounts.\u2019 He added: \u2018The records show Mr Mbaeri and not anybody else was the one person who accessed all the signature details for all the people who were victims of the fraud. \u2018The information was used to set up false standing orders by impersonating those people. \u2018Undoubtedly there were other people involved in the fraud as well who recruited people to allow their accounts to be used in the fraud. \u2018There was an agreement to impersonate Nationwide customers, Olawabiyi Ayanwale was the ringleader and a part of that plan was Mr Mbaeri. \u2018He agreed that the signatures and details he obtained would be put to that use.\u2019 Standing orders for around \u00a32,500 were set up from each of the victims\u2019 accounts, the court was told. The money was siphoned through the holding accounts before it was withdrawn in cash. Korrine Bright, 23, of Sydenham Hill, Lewisham, South East London, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit fraud and will be sentenced at the end of the trial. Mbaeri, of Hamilton Court, Ashby Place, Portsmouth, denies fraud by abuse of position and conspiracy to commit fraud.

Now 41, Landon has visited the crash scene and is thought to be the first child survivor to return to the countryside on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City where the C-5 military cargo plane crashed and broke up killing 78 children and 50 adults on April 4, 1975.

Emotional return: Landon Carnie visits the very spot in the paddy field in Vietnam where it is believed he and his twin sister Lorie were found huddled together as 17-month-old babies after miraculously surviving a horrific plane crash\u00a0that claimed the lives of nearly 80 babies and children 40 years ago on April 4, 1975 . Devastation: Landon and Lorie Carnie were thought to have died when the first flight of Operation Babylift \u2013 an evacuation of Vietnamese orphans and children before the Fall of Saigon \u2013 crashed minutes after take-off . Plucked from wreckage: The 17-month-old twins were found by a rice farmer in a paddy field a day after the disaster and later taken to their adoptive parents in the U.S. who had earlier been told they were dead . Incredible escape: Landon and Lorie had at first been placed on the lower cargo deck of the plane where they would almost certainly have died before a nurse moved them to the upper deck shortly after take-off . The tragic start to Operation Babylift \u2013 which eventually saw more than 3,000 vulnerable children evacuated to new lives overseas as Communist forces closed in on the southern capital \u2013 came as an explosion blew out the cargo doors as it climbed to 23,000 feet. The crew wrestled to bring the plane under control and were returning to Tan Song Nhut air base in Saigon when it crashed and broke into four blazing pieces short of the runway. There were 175 survivors. Landon and his sister had at first been placed on the lower cargo deck of the plane where they would almost certainly have died before a nurse caring for them moved them to the upper deck of the plane shortly after take-off. 'The two of us were put into one chair together,' said Landon, recalling stories he was told about the crash as a child. 'We were found over a day after the crash, right next to each other in a rice paddy. A rice farmer found us. 'My parents who had adopted us actually got a telegram saying we had died because we couldn't be found. And then, we were found.'

Poignant pilgrimage: Landon is now a lecturer in communications at the RMIT University in former Saigon, renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the war, after permanently relocating to the country in 2002 . All the orphans' documents including details of the birth parents, dates and places of birth were destroyed on board the inaugural Operation Babylift, which had been due to be met when it landed in the U.S. by President Gerard Ford. The twins were brought up in Washington State until \u2013 engrossed by a document on American TV about the 25th anniversary of Operation Babylift in 2000 \u2013 Landon decided to visit the country of his birth. He visited with his adoptive mother and then, two years later, decided to return to Vietnam to live. Landon is now a lecturer in communications at the RMIT University in former Saigon, renamed Ho Chi Minh City after the war. 'My adoptive parents were worried about me coming back at first,' Landon recalled. 'They said \"don't forget it's a Communist country and if you do something wrong you might be put in jail and never allowed to leave Vietnam\". 'They scared me a little bit and I was very careful about what I did and where I went when I first came back. 'But now I've been here for 13 years and I know exactly what I can say and do here.'

They built a shrine over the top of one fragment of the plane that was embedded in the ground to appease the spirits which superstitious villagers believe still haunt the fields. 'The spirits are still here,' said one villager. Another villager, an elderly woman who witnessed the crash, said the bodies were left in the fields for a long time because everyone except gangs of looters was too frightened to go near the wreckage. 'They (the children) were dead and they were left there,' she said. 'That is why those spirits are still around.'

A landlord who chopped his friend up and stuffed the body parts into suitcases which he dumped in a canal was today found guilty of murder. Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced victim Michael Spalding, 39, to decorate his flat before attacking him when he refused to work any longer. He then dismembered the handyman using a hacksaw and put Mr Spalding's body parts and tools into two suitcases. Simon, with the help of his girlfriend Michelle Bird, 35, then threw the suitcases into a canal which they weighed down using broken concrete slabs. Today he was found guilty of murder after a jury took 15 hours to decide by unanimous verdict at Birmingham Crown Court. Bird was cleared of murder and manslaughter but admitted assisting an offender following the four-week trial. The court heard Simon murdered Mr Spalding, known as Spud, by stabbing him in the neck at the flat they shared in Smethwick, Birmingham, on April 26 last year. He then hacked the body up and stuffed the head, limbs and tools into a suitcase. Police found his remains when a narrow boat owner spotted one suitcase, containing Mr Spalding's torso, floating in the Birmingham Canal on May 5. It was examined by a Canal Trust contractor on May 12, who opened the case to discover the gruesome evidence. Police divers recovered the second case which contained Mr Spalding's head, limbs and tools - below Pope Bridge, Smethwick, on May 16. Further searches of the canal bed uncovered a hacksaw which was used to saw off Mr Spalding's head. Using futuristic 3D scanning technology experts were able to show a perfect jigsaw fit between the charred bone and a severed limb found in the suitcase. The same technique - which provides image resolution 43,000 times more detailed that a hospital CT scan - proved a link between the hacksaw and lacerations found on other bones. Mr Spalding's body parts were found inside this suitcase, which was dumped in the Birmingham Canal . A second suitcase (pictured) containing Mr Spalding's grisly remains was discovered 11 days later . Drag marks were also found on the towpath near Pope's Bridge where Simon and Bird dumped the suitcases into the canal. Unemployed Simon, who has convictions for robbery, burglary, theft and supplying drugs, moved to Derby in a bid to evade police but was arrested with Bird on May 19. He denied knowledge of Mr Spalding's death, claiming he threw him out following a row over a car crash, but later admitted assaulting him during a fight. Neighbours reported seeing a bonfire in the garden and when officers raided the home they discovered part of a humerus bone inside the drum. Detectives later heard accounts from neighbours who told of 'aggressive, nasty' arguments coming from the flat. One recalled Simon saying: 'I want this place finished, I've got to live here, you are taking the p**s'. 3D scanning technology was able to prove a link between this hacksaw and lacerations found on Mr Spalding's bones . Mr Spalding was heard to reply: 'I'm tired, I'm hungry, I want to go home. I've been at it all day'. Adjourning the case until next Wednesday for sentencing, Justice Kathryn Thirlwall said: 'Lorenzo Simon you have been convicted of murder. As you know the sentence for murder is life imprisonment. 'The question is the minimum amount of time you should serve before the consideration of parole.' Speaking after the verdict, Detective Inspector Harry Harrison, of West Midlands Police, said: 'Michael was exploited in life by Lorenzo Simon and Michelle Bird and they afforded him no dignity in death. When police raided the home, parts of a humerus bone were discovered inside this charred drum . 'On the contrary, they treated him in the most despicable manner in order to conceal their crime. 'Simon accepted Michael as a tenant on the agreement he used his considerable handyman skills to do up the flat. 'But he treated him like a slave, working him past midnight and then waking him early in the morning to continue working. 'They were only allowed out with his say-so and given just one meal a day, usually pizza and chips. 'Michael finally broke and complained at their treatment. We believe that, combined with a car accident where Simon accused him of being responsible for damaging his VW Passat, led to the fatal attack. 'Simon said he hit Michael in the back and that he fell to the floor dead within seconds and claimed to have disposed of the body in panic. 'Bird said she was on an errand to buy alcohol at the time of the killing but later admitted helping her boyfriend in the aftermath. 'However, we were able to provide compelling evidence to the jury that this was a vicious murder and that Simon went to considerable lengths to try and cover his tracks.'", "summary": "Lorenzo Simon, 34, forced tenant Michael Spalding to decorate his flat.

After all, the actor was serious when he recently told Variety \"It will probably win best picture at the Oscars, unless the Oscars don't want to be relevant ever.\" But rather than ignore it because it's a glossy, blockbuster action film, some might argue that the movie goes against type for Academy Award nominated films because the cast is so diverse. \"Furious 7\" hits theaters Friday, months after controversy was stirred about the lack of diversity at the Oscars. There were no actors of color nominated and no women in the directing category, which was dominated by white males. Mexican filmmaker Alejandro Gonzalez I\u00f1arritu went on to win best director for \"Birdman.\" The lack of diversity was so glaring (even with the mostly black cast of the movie \"Selma,\" which received a nomination for best picture) that it spurred the Twitter hashtag \"#OscarsSoWhite.\" In contrast, \"Furious 7\" couldn't be more racially and ethnically inclusive. The cast includes Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson -- a Samoan/black man -- black actors Christopher \"Ludacris\" Bridges and Tyrese Gibson, Hispanic performer Michelle Rodriguez, Thai martial artist Tony Jaa, Beninese expatriate Djimon Hounsou and the late Paul Walker, a blue-eyed, blond-haired California native. The filmmakers even went so far as to make sure casting directors in Abu Dhabi and Dubai, where key scenes were filmed, found diverse extras. \"We were mainly looking for the diverse look of the (United Arab Emirates),\" Miranda Davidson, owner of the casting company, told The National. \"They really wanted to make sure we reflected the international feel of the country.\" Almost since the beginning, the \"Fast and Furious\" films have had a diverse focus and appeal.  The band of street racers, which encompassed white, black, Asian, Hispanic, male and female and bond as a family, has done well at the box office with each iteration. In 2011, then Boston Globe film critic Wesley Morris wrote, \"Go on and laugh your Benetton, Kumbaya, Kashi, quinoa laugh, but it's true: The most progressive force in Hollywood today is the 'Fast and Furious' movies.\" \"They're loud, ludicrous, and visually incoherent,\" he said. \"They're also the last bunch of movies you'd expect to see in the same sentence as 'incredibly important.' But they are -- if only because they feature race as a fact of life as opposed to a social problem or an occasion for self-congratulation. (And this doesn't even account for the gay tension between the male leads, and the occasional crypto-lesbian make-out.)\" According to the Motion Picture Association of America's 2014 Theatrical Market Statistics Report, while Hispanics make up 17% of the U.S. population they account for 25% of frequent moviegoers. Likewise, women make up 52% of moviegoers. Entertainment Weekly points out that the film franchise is doing a much better job of reflecting its audience than others in Hollywood. \"Despite the films' cumulative worldwide gross of almost $2.4 billion, their racial inclusiveness remains an outlier; American movies are still overwhelmingly white,\" EW's Chris Lee writes. \"According to UCLA's 2015 Hollywood Diversity Report, a mere 16.7% of 2013 films starred minorities in lead roles.\" At least one moviegoer tweeted that he appreciated the effort. Diesel told EW the franchise has come a long way from the original 2001 film, which featured segregated gangs of racers pitted against each other. \"It doesn't matter what nationality you are,\" the star said. \"As a member of the audience, you realize you can be a member of that 'family.'

Van Dijk, who scored Celtic's opener against Inverness, wants his side to bounce back and win the SPL title . And Van Dijk is now looking to wrap up the title in style to get over his Hampden disappointment. Celtic can reopen an eight-point lead over Aberdeen by winning at Dundee on Wednesday night ahead of the post-split fixtures. 'If we win the league we still improve from last year,' Van Dijk said. 'We want to win it as soon as possible and that starts on Wednesday. 'The disappointment is very high, everybody is down but we are professionals and we need to focus on Dundee. 'We need to move on. Wednesday night at Dundee is a big game, so we need to be ready for that.' Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths accused the match officials of robbing them a cup final appearance after they failed to spot his goal-bound header being stopped by the hand of Inverness defender Josh Meekings when the Hoops were leading 1-0. But Van Dijk refused to dwell on the blunder by referee Steven McLean and additional assistant Alan Muir, who was five yards away. When asked about the penalty claim, the Dutch defender said: 'It didn't happen so we can't talk about it.

Van Dijk opened the scoring at Hampden when he curled a free-kick in off the post but he and Jason Denayer were given a tough afternoon by the pacy Marley Watkins and powerful Edward Ofere, who scored Caley Thistle's second goal.

And above all, no violence. Raging hordes turned a deaf ear to that on Monday. But a handful of people repeated the family's message. They became criers in the desert against countless young people flinging rocks at police, breaking windows, looting and setting fires. The peacemakers -- clergy, Gray's family and brave residents -- placed themselves in the rioters' way. Their message was the same. \"I want them all to go back home,\" said Rev. Jamal Bryant. \"It's disrespect to the family. The family was very clear -- we've been saying it all along -- today there was absolutely no protest, no demonstration,\" he said. But the messengers were a finger in a dam that quickly crumbled, as rowdy groups swelled into a full urban riot. It overshadowed the message peaceful protesters delivered on prior days -- justice for Gray. The 25-year-old African-American man died from spinal injuries after being arrested earlier this month. The early fits of violence came in the afternoon, about the time mourners left Gray's memorial services blocks away, Rev. Bryant said. They bumped right into it. \"For us to come out of the burial and walk into this is absolutely inexcusable,\" he said. He did not want to see it spread to downtown Baltimore, where some rioters said it would, and organized people to stand in the way. \"We have a line of gentlemen from the Nation of Islam to build a human wall, as well as men from the Christian church making that human wall,\" he said. But as crowds turned into multitudes, the intervention became a drop in the bucket by compare, and police lines were also no match. As officers in riot gear receded, flames engulfed cars and stores and roared out of apartment buildings into the night sky. A senior living facility under construction by a Baptist church burned to the ground. The blazes stretched the fire departments' resources, as at least 30 trucks deployed. Looters streamed into a CVS, bodegas and liquor stores and walked out with what they could carry. A young man in a blue sweatshirt tried to talk people down by himself. He walked up to CNN correspondent Miguel Martinez, as a store nearby was being looted. It later went up in flames. The man, who didn't say his name, was disgusted at what was happening in his neighborhood and disappointed in the police response to rioting. There was a line of police down the street, not far away. \"They could have moved down here to stop it,\" he told Martinez. The Gray family's lawyers, again, put the family's wish out to the public that there be no protests that day, let alone violence. It's marring the cause and hope for change that may have come out of the investigation into Freddie Gray's death, said family attorney Mary Koch. \"That's just disintegrated into just looking at Baltimore city and thinking that the city is the city of violence,\" she said. Against all odds, a handful of individuals kept trying to stop it. A tall, adult man walked up to a young man who was confronting riot police. He slung an arm over his shoulder, turned him back around in the other direction and marched him away from police lines. But as they strolled past a crowd, a young man behind them hurled a stone at police, putting his whole body into the throw. At least one young man paid the price for his participation, when his mother turned up to spank him home. Before running cameras, she slapped him in the head again and again, driving him away from the crowd, as she cursed. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts later thanked her. \"I wish I had more parents that took charge of their kids out there tonight,\" he said. After night fell, giving way to a 10 p.m. curfew for juveniles, Robert Valentine stood alone with his back to a line of police in riot gear. He shooed away young people tempted to approach them. \"Go! Step your --ss away!\" \"I'm just a soldier,\" said Valentine. He told CNN's Joe Johns that he was a veteran of the Vietnam War. Young people had no business on the streets, he said. \"They need to be in their home units studying and doing something with their lives.\" Even Baltimore members of the Crips and Bloods, two street gangs renowned for drug dealing and extensive violent crime -- and for killing each other -- came together with others who condemned the rage that swept through their neighborhoods. \"The guys who pulled me aside are self-identifying as Crips and say they don't approve of whats happening. 'This is our community,'\" wrote Baltimore Sun reporter Justin Fenton on his confirmed Twitter account. Gangs members joined community leaders and Gray's family for a press conference Monday night on the stage at New Shiloh Baptist Church, which had held Gray's funeral. An announcer thanked them for coming to the church. The gangs have signed a peace deal and are uniting to push against police lines in protests, according to a report by the Daily Beast. Rev. Bryant also mentioned their peace treaty. But police say the gangs' purpose goes much further -- that they and another gang called the Black Guerilla Family plan to 'take out' law enforcement officers, police said. \"This is a credible threat.\" The gangs are consistently pursued by the FBI. At the end of the day, Gray's family had the last word on the violence at the press conference. It wasn't good. \"To see that it turned into all this violence and destruction, I am appalled,\" said Richard Shipley, Gray's stepfather. \"I want y'all to get justice for my son, but don't do it like this here,\" said Gray's mother Gloria Darden, who wore a T-shirt with her son's photo. \"I don't think that's for Freddie,\" his twin sister Fredericka Gray said. \"I think the violence is wrong.\" After their comments, Gray family lawyer William H. Murphy took the microphone. Violence is not the path to change, he said. Then he got back to the message than had been bitterly marred by the rioting. Murphy asked for a show of hands in the church audience of people who had experienced police brutality or personally knew someone who did.

Gaza police have seized the work 'under a court order' from Bilal Khaled, who is accused of buying the piece painted on a door belonging to the Darduna family without telling them its real value. The now homeless family in the impoverished Islamist-run Palestinian enclave says they were 'tricked' into parting with the valuable collector's item by the world famous street artist.

It is now being held at Khan Yunis public library . The mural painted on the Darduna family's door (left) and the doorway of the ruined house after it was sold . At the end of February, the artist, who chooses to remain anonymous, released an online video showing three works he painted on the walls of Gaza homes destroyed in Israeli air strikes. The disputed graffiti shows Greek goddess Niobe weeping on a metal doorway which was all that remained standing of the Darduna family home. Khaled said it 'will be stored at Khan Yunis public library until this issue is resolved'. Rabie Darduna confirmed this to AFP, adding that the family 'has filed a complaint against Bilal Khaled for fraud and to demand justice in retrieving the graffiti'. Khaled countered: 'I'm going to exercise my rights over this graffiti because I have the paperwork to prove that I own it.' The elusive Banksy produced the artwork during a secret visit to Gaza that was blasted in a summer war last year between Israel and the Hamas movement that runs the territory.

'He gave me 700 shekels (around $200) and went off with the door.' Darduna said he later felt cheated for letting the door go for so little when collectors have paid more than a million dollars for a Banksy. The artist's works were seen as a damning critique of Israel's bombardment of Gaza as it battled Hamas, destroying or damaging more than 100,000 homes and killing nearly 2,200 Palestinians, most of them civilians. Banksy's murals also include a giant cat painted on the last remaining wall of a Gaza home playing with a ball of twisted metal. The artist's online video about his trip to Gaza was entitled 'Make this the year YOU discover a new destination'.

The news comes as David Cameron today reiterates his pledge to offer the cut-price properties to 200,000 young first-time buyers. The project, launched last month, is part of a dramatic extension of the Help to Buy scheme \u2013 and doubles the number of new starter homes in England from 100,000 to 200,000. Help to buy: The extension to the scheme has been well-received with 50,000 people registering interest in the scheme since it launched last month . The properties would be at prices 20 per cent cheaper than their market value and reserved purely for first-time buyers under the age of 40. Mr Cameron will say today: \u2018Home ownership goes to the heart of our political beliefs. It\u2019s simple: we believe having a home of their own gives people and families independence; it helps people stand on their own two feet; and it\u2019s one of the ultimate symbols of a country where if you work hard, you can get on.\u2019 Figures published yesterday reveal 52,000 people have already registered an interest since the scheme was launched last month. The 20 per cent discount is possible because the new properties will be exempted from taxes and reduced construction costs thanks to the release of cheaper, brownfield commercial land to build on. Affordable homes:\u00a050,000 Britons have signed up to a scheme offering discount starter homes to those desperate to get on the housing ladder . As well as helping struggling young people wanting to buy a home, Tory strategists believe it will appeal to parents and grandparents worried about their families\u2019 prospects of ever getting onto the property ladder. Each starter home will cost no more than \u00a3250,000 outside London and \u00a3450,000 in the capital. First-time buyers will also be able to combine the 20 per cent discount with a Help to Buy mortgage \u2013 which offers homeseekers a 20 per cent Government-backed equity loan. The Help to Buy equity loan scheme was introduced in 2013 to offer buyers a 20 per cent Government loan to buy new properties, worth up to 95 per cent loan to value. It was due to expire in 2016 but has been extended until 2020. Under Labour, housebuilding fell to levels not seen since the 1920s.

Shelling began to boom through the Yemeni city of Aden on Thursday afternoon as we hurried back to board the boat that had brought us here from Djibouti. Aden is a city gripped by fear, desperation and want. People line up for bread, they line up for cooking fuel, and the electricity only works a few hours a day. And from late afternoon onward, most people stay indoors. That is the time of the shelling, the daily aerial bombardment. How we got to Yemen: 30 dangerous hours in a boat . Saudi Arabia began airstrikes on Houthi rebels in Yemen three weeks ago Thursday. But Aden remains a city not fully in the hands either of Houthi rebels or forces loyal to the ousted government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Everyone we spoke to Thursday told us the same thing: Living in Aden these days is terrifying. We visited a hospital where doctors have given up trying to count the dead and the dying who are brought in. Officials said they believe the toll of the dead runs into the hundreds. Everywhere, we felt, saw, heard and smelled the desperation. We spoke to some of the loyalist military commanders. They said they felt they were pushing back the Houthi forces. The Houthis forced Hadi from power in January, though Hadi still claims to be Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to Yemen. Those allied with Hadi have accused the Iranian government of supporting the Houthis in their uprising in Yemen. 'A window into hell': Desperate Yemenis flee Saudi airstrikes by boat . Since Saudi Arabia began aerial raids March 26, it has launched more than 1,200 airstrikes. Saudi officials said they have killed more than 500 Houthi rebels. But the reality is that a good portion of the armaments the Saudis send in on guided parachutes fall instead into Houthi hands. There is, to be sure, a sense that three weeks into this operation, the Saudis are making some headway with the strikes. But given how far along they are into the operation, the expectation would have been -- especially given the aerial cover the Saudis are providing for loyalist forces on the ground -- that the Houthi forces would have been pushed further back. That hasn't happened. Why is Saudi Arabia bombing Yemen? The government loyalists have gained territory; that is why we were able to dock. There is an area around one of the smaller ports that is reliably in government hands. But Aden's main port will be hugely strategic for any potential ground incursion. Those forces will need to be reinforced and supplied through somewhere -- and the port is at the top of the list. Given that control of the city is still divided, there is a feeling that not enough of what the Saudis set out to do has been accomplished. The loyalists were frank with us. We are outgunned, they said. We are fighting a force that is superior to us in terms of its arms, tanks and artillery. \"We're fighting them with automatic machine guns,\" the loyalists told us. \"Those reinforcements aren't getting in to us in time.\" CNN's Don Melvin in London contributed to this report.", "summary": "Control of strategic seaport of Aden divided between Houthi rebels and government loyalists.

Scientists analysed 57 species in the region and found that the majority of populations had diminished as a result of the nuclear accident. They found that one breed in particular had plummeted from several hundred before the 2011 disaster to just a few dozen today. Researchers have found that bird species are continuing to drop in Fukushima (shown after the disaster in 2011). The barn swallow, for example, dropped from hundreds to dozens. This is despite radiation levels in the region starting to fall. And comparing it to Chernobyl could reveal what the future holds . The research, published in the Journal of Ornithology, was carried out by scientists at the University of South Carolina including biologist Dr Tim Mousseau. They showed that the situation has steadily worsened since the disaster on 11 March 2011. On that day, just over four years ago, Japan\u2019s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant was heavily damaged by an earthquake and its resultant tsunami. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. This led to three of the plant\u2019s six nuclear reactors going into meltdown and releasing radioactive materials. Reports claim the soil and water in the region still contains high levels of radiation which makes the clean-up effort difficult. A total of 300,000 people evacuated the Fukushima area on the east coast and 15,884 people died due to the earthquake and tsunami. Many populations were found to have diminished in number as a result of the accident, with several species suffering dramatic declines. One of the most hard-hit species is the barn swallow, Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure. \u2018We know that there were hundreds in a given area before the disaster, and just a couple of years later we're only able to find a few dozen left,\u2019 said Dr Mousseau. \u2018The declines have been really dramatic.\u2019 And while background radiation has declined in the region in recent years, the negative effects of the accident on birds are actually increasing. \u2018The relationship between radiation and numbers started off negative the first summer, but the strength of the relationship has actually increased each year,\u2019 Dr Mousseau said. \u2018So now we see this really striking drop-off in numbers of birds as well as numbers of species of birds. \u2018So both the biodiversity and the abundance are showing dramatic impacts in these areas with higher radiation levels, even as the levels are declining.\u2019 Dr Tim Mousseau and his team made the findings using thermoluminescent detectors, which use gamma-radiation-sensitive crystals (shown) to measure radiation doses in individual subjects living in the wild . One hard-hit species was the barn swallow (stock image shown), Hirundo rustica, which suffered large population losses due to radiation exposure . The team are hoping to get information on what the future holds for Fukushima from the Chernobyl site, which was the scene of a devastating release of radioactive materials in Ukraine in 1986. One difference noticed so far is that migratory birds fared worse in Chernobyl, whereas it was year-round residents that were doing worse at Fukushima. This could be due to differences in DNA repair capabilities for migratory species as a result of flapping their wings - which lowers their antioxidant levels and makes them more vulnerable to radiation. The Fukushima nuclear disaster was a failure at the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant on 11 March 2011. It was caused when the plant was hit by a tsunami, triggered by the 9.0 Tohoku earthquake. Shown are radiation levels immediately after the accident in 2011 .", "summary": "Researchers find that bird species are continuing to drop in Fukushima.

After last summer\u2019s mammoth trek across the United States, an angry United manager Van Gaal vowed that it would never happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Now Sportsmail can reveal that Van Gaal and United have turned down offers from Asia and Australia and are about to sign off a visit to America \u2013 in all likelihood to the west coast. The trip will last in the region of 12 days \u2013 a whole week shorter than last summer - and will be over by August 1. Manchester United beat Real Madrid in Michigan last summer in front of 109,000 fans . United played four games in America last pre-season, here Wayne Rooney scores against LA Galaxy . United beat Liverpool in the final to win the International Champions Cup last summer . While rivals such as Manchester City are trekking around Australia, Van Gaal and his United players will operate out of one base in America and travel to their games from there. The club have agreed once again to rake part in the International Champions Cup that they won last summer by beating Liverpool in a final in Miami. The tournament is played all over America but this time the promoters have essentially allowed United to choose their own venues as they are so desperate to have England\u2019s most famous club in it. Details of the competition were supposed to be announced last week with United given a provisional deadline to commit to their schedule by last Friday. However, the announcement has been put on hold while Van Gaal and United tweak final details. Last season, Van Gaal joined United after the World Cup in Brazil to find the club committed to a two-and-half week marathon comprising visits to Los Angeles, Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and, finally, Miami. Rooney scored another spectacular goal for United against Aston Villa last weekend . Following their tour of America, United suffered a slow start but are now firing on all cylinders in the league . The Dutch veteran was furious at the itinerary that he felt asked too much of his players as they were constantly asked to fly in to different time zones and even play at altitude in Colorado. Having to then play the final in Florida during a thunderstorm was the final straw. For long periods of this winter\u2019s negotiations, Van Gaal and United seemed set to commit to a schedule on America\u2019s East Coast. It is understand, however, that Van Gaal has recently performed a volte face and expressed a preference for the more agreeable climates of the west. Van Gaal has insisted this time that his team will travel to match venues from one base and will have no repeat of the arduous treks endured to games in Pasadena and Ann Arbor last year.

(Serpent\u2019s Tail \u00a314.99) Famously and memorably, the poet Philip Larkin asked: 'Why should I let the toad work / Squat on my life?' He longed to be '... courageous enough / To shout Stuff your pension! - but knew he never would. Coffee morning: Britain at work . The tyranny of the nine-to-five is about money (of course), but also about moral worth: we work because we know we should 'pull our weight' in society's tug-of-war. On any morning, in any town or city all over the world, people stream into their places of work, some driven by a sense of vocation, some by resigned boredom, some by greed, some by need. Surely it is work, not love, which makes the world go round? Joanna Biggs offers an excellent contribution to our knowledge of the world of work in all its variety - not through tedious sociological analysis (thank goodness), but through the stories of real people she has interviewed all over the country. Reading this book reminds me how times have changed dramatically since my generation left school or college in the Sixties with no worries about finding a job. We were lucky. Joanna Biggs makes it bleakly clear that for many people today, 'the idea that good work brings a good life no longer holds'. Biggs divides her workers in interesting categories, yoking disparate occupations in terms of their overall function. So the 'Making' chapter gives us a potter, a shoemaker and (yes) a robot, which introduces us to its maintenance engineers. 'Serving' includes a sex worker, two baristas, a call centre adviser and a political special adviser. Those 'Repairing' are a rabbi, an Army major and a nurse, while those 'Leading' are a company director, a stay-at-home mum (inspired, that one) and a hereditary lord. Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me' The scope of the book is broad. We meet those who are selling, entertaining, thinking, caring - as well as a curious clutch of people Biggs lumps together under 'Starting': a goldsmith's apprentice (one of my favourites), a rebellious intern, an entrepreneur specialising in 'start-up' technologies, an unemployed graduate. There's also a 56-year-old man on Mandatory Work Activity, usually known as 'workfare' - the Government initiative designed for those on Jobseeker's Allowance, to help them 'gain a better understanding of the discipline and focus required for work... while at the same time making a contribution to the community'. Joanna Biggs clearly does not think very much of 'workfare': in fact, it's clear she despises the scheme. Here, although of course anyone can see that the system is not perfect, I wish she hadn't editorialised so overtly. I really wanted to hear more about what John thought of his life. A book which aims to give the reader much-needed insight into other people's lives (and it certainly does that) seems to me to be spoilt by degenerating into a student newspaper leader: 'A citizen's income set at the right level - \u00a3320 a week is the current estimate - would kill off the sort of unproductive and low-paid jobs that have proliferated since 2008 in the UK.' At that point the author does not speculate what disastrous effects such indiscriminate largesse could have on the economy, with inevitable repercussions for the very men and women she has met. ALL DAY LONG By Joanna Biggs . In the Seventies I was a huge admirer of the work of America's Studs Terkel and England's Tony Parker, both oral historians who aimed to give insight into the lives of those with no voice, by using recorded interviews, carefully transcribed, with no questions included and no comment or judgment. It was a magnificent technique which catapulted the reader movingly (and sometimes shockingly) into the hearts and minds of prisoners, drifters, miners, people on a housing estate, and so on. You felt you got to know them without the author-interviewer standing in the way - although, of course, all interviews have to be edited. Joanna Biggs invokes Terkel: 'I've often wondered what (he) would think of how we think about work now.' Well, I reckon the great man would continue to record what he heard, without surprise, and without trying to fit life stories into a pre-conceived mould. In contrast, Biggs writes: 'I continuously heard that people loved their jobs, and sometimes this worried me: it felt as if work was becoming more insecure on one hand, and the work ethic increasingly revered on the other.' At the end, she lays her cards on the table, confessing that as she listened to people's stories, 'I most often wished for the way we work as a society to be organised more fairly and hoped for more resistance to the way it's organised now.' That's the trouble with the workers, you see. They've always been unpredictable individuals who may like or dislike their jobs but just get on with life, turning their backs on revolution.", "summary": "Joanna Biggs tells\u00a0the stories of real people she has interviewedin the UK.

In 2008, Naomi Jacobs - then aged 32 - woke up terrified of her son, in totally unrecognisable surroundings and thought she was 15 years old. Overnight, she had been struck with Transient Global Amnesia, a form of memory loss brought on by stress that had wiped the 'episodic' part of her memory. Naomi Jacobs was 32 when she woke up one morning having lost her memory of the past 17 years of her life . The last thing she could remember was falling asleep in her bunk bed as a schoolgirl, dreaming about a boy she had a crush on. She thought it was 1992, John Major was prime minister and she was about to sit her GCSEs. Mobile phones were still the size of a house brick, the internet a mystery - and her 10-year-old son was a stranger. But Miss Jacobs told the BBC it was when her son bounded up to her yelling 'mum' that she succumbed to 'total shock'. She said: 'Everything from fear to joy from seeing this child that I didn't have any memory of giving birth to, but knew undoubtedly that he was mine because he looked so much like me, to terror of having the responsibility of this small child. 'I was convinced that I was going to fall asleep again that night and wake up in 1992. It wasn't real to me what was happening.' Miss Jacobs pictured as a 15-year-old - the age she believed she was when she woke up one morning when struck by amnesia in her early 30s . Miss Jacobs had Transient Global Amnesia, a form of memory loss brought on by stress. It affects five in 100,000 people in Britain, rising to 23 in 100,000 in the over 50s. Before her attack, Miss Jacobs, of Manchester, was worrying about a homeopathy business she ran. She was studying for a psychology degree and had her final exams approaching, and had recently split up with the father of her child. The condition caused the 'episodic' part of her memory to shut down, meaning she had lost all her emotional memories. But her semantic memory was still intact, meaning she could remember things she had repeated over time such as how to drive and phone numbers she had regularly dialled. Miss Jacobs has previously described lying awake at night and crying as she desperately tried to make sense of her life and longed to be back at school. She is now set to detail how she began to understand who she was in a new book, titled Forgotten Girl. The book reveals how she went about piecing her life back together using her personal diaries and those close to her. There is no specific treatment for Transient Global Amnesia other than support and reassurance from family and loved ones. Fortunately, Miss Jacobs had this support, and after eight weeks her memory began to return to normal. Transient global amnesia (TGA) is a type of amnesia involving the sudden, temporary disturbance in an otherwise healthy person's memory. The leading hypotheses are some form of epileptic event, a problem with blood circulation around, to or from the brain, or some kind of migraine-like phenomenon. TGA attacks are associated with some form of precipitating event in at least one-third of cases. In females, this event is more often of a strong emotional character; in males, it is more often related to some physical exertion. The most commonly cited precipitating events include sexual intercourse, swimming in cold water or enduring other temperature changes, and emotionally traumatic or stressful events. TGA is most common in people between age 56 and 75, with the average age of a person experiencing TGA being approximately 62.", "summary": "Naomi Jacobs woke up one morning believing she was 15 years old.

{"id": "1002ffb7a3bdaca4399f1c0f1774bd9ba31be097", "text": "(CNN)Silent, almost shy as she headed into Manhattan Criminal Court, Ailina Tsarnaeva was anything but timid when it came to a perceived rival, prosecutors say. According to a criminal complaint, Tsarnaeva threatened a woman in a phone call this summer, saying \"Leave my man alone.\" \"Stop looking for him. ... I know people that can put a bomb where you live,\" she said, according to the complaint. Considering who was making the threats, prosecutors didn't consider it a joke and charged Tsarnaeva with aggravated harassment, which she denies. Leaving court last December, she and her lawyer refused to discuss the case. Tsarnaeva is the sister of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev. Authorities allege the brothers are responsible for the 2013 Boston marathon bombing, which left three people dead and more than 260 others injured. Police shot and killed Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, during the manhunt and later captured Dzhokhar, who is now on trial. Tsarnaev's lawyers don't dispute that he did it. The defense argues that he was influenced and enlisted by his older, self-radicalized brother to commit acts of terror. Defense rests in Boston Marathon bombing trial . The Tsarnaev family first immigrated to the Boston area back in 2002. The parents, fleeing a troubled region of Russia, were treated as legal residents and granted asylum -- a status that opened the door for taxpayer-funded welfare. The state of Massachusetts has confirmed the Tsarnaevs received food stamps, public housing and other aid, on and off, between 2002 and 2012. During this time, Tamerlan Tsarnaev began his conversion to radical Islam. Then, according to investigators, he began filling his younger brother's head with a hatred toward the West. Not much is known about the two Tsarnaeva daughters, Ailina, 24, and Bella, 26, though their last known address was in North Bergen, New Jersey. Along with charges of making bomb threats, Ailina Tsarnaeva has a past record that includes misleading police in a counterfeiting case. She pleaded guilty but got no jail time. She was also charged with leaving the scene of an accident, but that charge was dismissed. Her older sister, Bella, was charged with marijuana possession and intent to distribute after a 2012 arrest, and she entered a pretrial intervention program. Even their mother, Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, has had issues with the law. She fled back to Russia in 2012, where she remains a fugitive. Records show that she was arrested in June 2012 for allegedly shoplifting $1,600 worth of women's clothing from a Boston-area Lord & Taylor department store. She is wanted on felony charges of shoplifting and destruction of property. Russia raised concerns to U.S. authorities about her in 2011 at the same time they asked the United States about her son Tamerlan, several sources told CNN shortly after the 2013 attack. U.S. authorities added the mother and son to the Terrorist Identities Datamart Environment, or TIDE, database -- a collection of more than a half-million names maintained by the National Counterterrorism Center, an intelligence official said. FBI agents interviewed Zubeidat Tsarnaev as part of the investigation into her son, whose case was closed after several months. The radicalization of Tsarnaev . In Russia, she has maintained her innocence in the shoplifting case while also calling the charges against her sons \"made up.\" Though not elaborating on her beliefs, Ailina Tsarnaeva has said she believes, as her mother does, that her surviving brother Dzhokhar and her dead brother Tamerlan are innocent. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, now 21, faces 30 criminal counts, including using a weapon of mass destruction causing death. On Tuesday, one day after federal prosecutors rested after calling more than 90 witnesses, defense lawyers rested their case without calling Tsarnaev to the stand.
